# TIFF_webApp_BE
I am developing a web application that manages volunteers at the Transylvania International Film Festival. BackEnd is done using the following frameworks: Java with SpringBoot for REST API calls from FrontEnd (tested using Postman and Axio). Data is generated randomly using Faker (com.github.javafaker.Faker). BE notifies FE when server is down.
